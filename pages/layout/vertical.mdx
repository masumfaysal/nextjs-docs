A breadcrumb or breadcrumb trail is a graphical control element used as a navigational aid in user interfaces and on web pages. It allows users to keep track and maintain awareness of their locations within programs, documents, or websites.

**Side navigation:**

Side navigation is a hierarchical, vertical navigation component featured on the right or left side of a page or screen.

**Top Navigation:**

Compared to a left navigation, a top navigation saves more vertical page space. The left column of your page is taken up by the navigation links when you use a left navigation. Your page's content area will be reduced in size as a result, leaving less room for information.


**Footer:**

The footer of a website is a section that appears below the main body of information on each page. The word "footer" originates from the print industry, where it refers to a unified design element that appears on all pages of a publication.
